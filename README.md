![Solar System Age Calculator](public/assets/repo_title.svg)

A small web application that calculates your age and how long you have to plan for your next birthday party on every planet in the Solar System.

The application also displays some interesting/fun information about each of the planets via a modal popup when the user clicks on a planet image.

I am building this application while working through [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), as I want to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript before progressing further along the course curriculum for [Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/38892394?start=1#overview). In general, before delving into databases and React, I want to:

* Get more experience handling constants, variables, arrays, objects, maps and sets.
* Keep my CSS knowledge fresh by adding new features.
* Solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation in vanilla JS outside of frameworks.
* (Experimentally - potentially have a go at creating my own SVG icons in Inkscape.)

My work here will be reasonably on-off as I switch between periods of pure learning and periods of applying what I've learned. However, I have decided to set out a roadmap for this app below to indicate features I plan to develop in the near future.

## Plan your party!
This will introduce a new page for the user to visit that will help them host their planetary birthday party. The user will be able to: 
* Provide guest information.
* Generate cocktail recipes, with a drinks shopping list determined by the number of guests.
* Allow the user to tick off key milestones in their party planning.
* Generate RSVPs for prospective guests.

## Database storage
Once I have completed learning on database integration, I will then aim to integrate data recorded (see above) into a database in order to enable persistent storage.

## Log In
Once I have integrated a database, I will look to add a log in system.
